# intro

In this article, we will see how to build a distributed cache system from scratch,
this is the first part of our articles.

## set the basic environment

first of all, let's simply create a folder to store all project, the command should look like this: `mkdir cache`.

you should start a new go project with `go mod init something`, for example: `go mod init cacheme`,
then you can find a `go.mod` file appears in your directory.

Since we have a project, we can create a `main.go` file in our project to print `hello, world`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("vim-go")
}
```

Now, it's time to run the project with `go run main.go`,
your can also compile it to a binary with `go build -o hello main.go` and input `./hello` to run this binary executable file.

the other things we could do (but not necessary) are listed as follows:

- add `.gitignore` file so that we can ignore some useless files likeÂ .DS_Store in mac environment
- add a read me so that everyone else could understand what this project is used for.
- add a license, I personally prefer some loose licenses like MIT or GPL3
