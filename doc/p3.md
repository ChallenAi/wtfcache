## Expose popular HTTP API for users

There are different ways to expose HTTP API in golang,
for examples, the `net/http`, `fasthttp`,
we can use some high level web framework to expose too: `gin`, `martini`, `echo`.

The `fasthttp` provide competitive performance when the throughput is higher,
The web framework is much easier to use and maintain.

In this project, we employ the basic `net/http` from golang standard library.
The only thing we need to to is implement `func Handle(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request)` in the case of standard library.
Therefore, we can route our request as follows:

```go
func CacheRoute(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	switch req.Method {
	case http.MethodGet:
		HandleGetKey(w, req)
	case http.MethodPost:
		HandleSetKey(w, req)
	case http.MethodDelete:
		HandleDelKey(w, req)
	default:
		HandleNotFound(w, req)
	}
}

func HandleGetKey(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    // cache.Get(req.Path)
}

func HandleSetKey(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    // cache.Set(req.Body.Key, req.Body.Value)
}

func HandleDelKey(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    // cache.Del(req.Path)
}

func HandleNotFound(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    // w.Write("not found")
}
```

now, we can bootstrap our http cache server to store keys in both memory and disk!
