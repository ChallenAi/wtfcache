## Expose high performance TCP API for users

Different from HTTP protocol, we build TCP service from scratch without any framework,  
The main reason is that the TCP only serve in the specific high performance case,
the protocol is not actually standardlized due to the consideration of performance.

Since it's a cache application, we can communicate with client via redis compatable protocal,
so that the redis client can talk to our application directly.
By the way, It's not difficult to design a new protocol for special use case, but it's unnecessary to repeat.

The current Redis protocol is called RESP v3.
